# Products_CRUD_Operations

To Run the code please import the project as a Maven project.
Do a mvn clean and mvn install to get all the dependencies we need to run the code.

Once the dependencies are all loaded run the application as a SpringBootApplication.

I used Swagger to alias the UI to make the rest calls.
You can access the Swagger endpoints via this endpoint.
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/


Dependencies used:
1. spring-boot-starter-web
2. spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
3. mysql-connector-java
4. spring-boot-devtools
5. Swagger
   -> springfox-swagger2
   -> springfox-swagger-ui
